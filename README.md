# nextjs-13-tutorial

This project is largely inspired by the Fireship NextJS 13 tutorial.

# Tools used

This project uses:

- NextJS 13 experimental version
- Pocketbase
- Docker
- Tailwind

# Deployment

I deployed the NextJS app on Vercel, and I deployed PocketBase on a fly.io instance.

# How to

To start developing, run the following commands:

- `npm run db` starts pocketbase locally in a docker container.
- open `https://localhost:8090/_/` to set up pocketbase account and collection
- `npm run dev` starts nextjs dev server
